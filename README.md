# Angular Microfrontend Demo

The goal of this demo is to provide an example of how to create an angular microfrontend and integrate it on different hosts (angular, python, react, plain javascript).

## Microfrontend

In the root of the repository we find **weather-microfront.js** wich is the microfrontend bundle to distribute to the host application.

To focus on microfronted implementation and building review [microfrontend-workspace](microfrontend-workspace/README.md).

## Hosts

Review projects basic integration examples:

- [Angular example](host-angular/README.md)
- [Python example](host-python/README.md)
- [React example](host-react/README.md)
- [Pure Javascript example](host-vanilla-javascript/README.md)

## Comming soon

- Cross-application communication
- Shared component library
- Microfrontend load
- Microfrontend versioning
- Microfrontend distribution
